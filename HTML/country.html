        <p>India, officially the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by
            area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian
            Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land
            borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to
            the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and
            Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia. India is the fifth largest
            economy in the world as per World Bank data in 2022.</p><br>
        <p>According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2021 was nominally worth $3.04
            trillion; and is the sixth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is around $10.219 trillion, the
            third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the
            past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012, India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.
            However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.
            Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist
            economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside
            world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy; since then
            it has moved slowly towards a free-market system by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment
            inflows. India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.</p><br>
        <p>The Constitution of India is the supreme law of India. The document lays down the framework that demarcates
            fundamental political code, structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions and sets
            out fundamental rights, directive principles, and the duties of citizens. It is the longest written national
            constitution in the world. it had 395 articles in 22 parts and 8 schedules. At about 145,000 words, it is
            the second-longest active constitution—after the Constitution of Alabama—in the world.</p><br>
        <p>The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government receive their power from the constitution and are bound by it. With the aid of its constitution, India is governed by a parliamentary system of government with the executive directly accountable to the legislature.

                Under Articles 52 and 53: the president of India is head of the executive branch
                Under Article 60: the duty of preserving, protecting, and defending the constitution and the law.
                Under Article 74: the prime minister is the head of the Council of Ministers, which aids and advises the president in the performance of their constitutional duties.
                Under Article 75(3): the Council of Ministers is answerable to the lower house.
                The constitution is considered federal in nature, and unitary in spirit. It has features of a federation, including a codified, supreme constitution; a three-tier governmental structure (central, state and local); division of powers; bicameralism; and an independent judiciary. It also possesses unitary features such as a single constitution, single citizenship, an integrated judiciary, a flexible constitution, a strong central government, appointment of state governors by the central government, All India Services (the IAS, IFS and IPS), and emergency provisions. This unique combination makes it quasi-federal in form.</p><br>
